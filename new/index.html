                <h2> <u> Sushant Singh Rajput in Bollwood</u></h2>
                
                <p>The show went on to be his ‘big break’ and led him to the gates of Bollywood. He debuted in the film Kai Po Che! which was a huge success and everyone adored the new boy in town. However, things really changed for the best for him when he starred as former Indian cricket team captain MS Dhoni in the cricketer’s biopic --  ‘MS Dhoni- The Untold Story’.

                    It made him into one of the top leading actors in the Indian film industry and the film was marked as one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of 2016. </p>
                
                <p>His last commercial film that taught us an important lesson was Chhichhore. The movie’s message to the audience was that no matter how difficult things get, suicide is never an option.</p>
                
                <p>It breaks our hearts to know that this is the way he had to go, especially after spreading this message. 

                    Depression and mental health issues are very real and we desperately need to start addressing them. The taboo around depression plays a strong hand in making people feel vulnerable and helpless. It’s time to end the stigma.</p>
